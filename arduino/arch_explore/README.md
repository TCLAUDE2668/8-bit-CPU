Exploring the Flags
===================

This is a small sketch to explore a bit of how AVR processor handles flags. I might try to
emulate the behaviour in my own CPU arch.

Generate template assembly file from .ctmpl using make_asm.sh script. Then edit the
assembly as desired. And finally - test behaviour from Arduino sketch.
