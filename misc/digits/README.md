Formerly EEPROM burner
======================

This set of utilities started out as an EEPROM programmer, inspired by [Ben Eater's one][be-prog].

It was replaced by XmProg programmer, that accepts arbitrary binary files for uploading to EEPROM
and Multi-Purpose Flash chips.

What remains here is a small utility that generates binary image file for 7-segment display ROM.
